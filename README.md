# CI-processor-analysis-setup
Functions to characterize cochlear implant processors using an experimental setup.
Note: The Nucleus Matlab Toolbox is should be installed.

Setup main functions are the essential functions for creating electrodograms
Setup extra functions are additional functions used during this project.
Folders:
  Plotting NMT, for visualizing characteristics of the NMT simulations
  Sound File Functions, for generating wav files for the experimental setup
  Wvfread, Read Yokogawa *.wvf files (Benkler, (2009)) 
  Wvfread to NMT, functions for converting output of wvfread (Benkler, E. (2009)) to the input of electrodograms of NMT (Swanson, Mauch, (2009))
